## Title: Seurat vs Scanpy

## Objective
This project benchmarks two popular scRNA-seq analysis packages Seurat (R) and Scanpy (Python) using the same parameters to investigate differences in clustering, marker identification, and overall data interpretation. The goal is to understand how implementation differences affect downstream results and to determine which package best suits according to the research needs.

## Tools and Dependencies
1. Seurat (R)
2. Scanpy (Python)

## Input Files
1. The analysis uses a 10X Genomics multi-modal H5 file (filtered_feature_bc_matrix.h5). Data Source: GSE254758
2. For this project, only the gene expression (scRNA-seq) data is extracted.

## Execution
1. Clone the repository.
2. Download the necessary input files from GEO
3. Install the required tools and dependencies in R and Python
4. Run the provided code files

## Output Files
1. Intermediate plots are generated at each step.
2. Final Output files are produced.
3. Result Plots for each Tool are available in the Repository
